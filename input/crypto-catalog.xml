		<!-- 1.1 Purpose -->
		<section title="Purpose" id="catsec-purpose">
			The Common Criteria Development Board (CCDB) tasked the Crypto Working Group with writing a specification 
			for cryptographic SFRs for use in Common Criteria evaluations. The purpose of this document is to provide
			filled-in templates of cryptographic requirements for developers of protection profiles to chose from.
			This should result in better standardization and more consistent usage of FCS family requirements across
			all protection profiles.<br/><br/>
			The template requirements in this document are based on SFRs published in CC:2022 Part 1. Blah blah blah.

		<!-- Intended audience -->
